# Pre and Post Event Engagement

Hello!
Welcome to the README for the Pre and Post Event Engagement fro the Mozilla Open Leaders Program. I am Rachel, Events Program Manager from the Wikimedia Foundation.

 I am working with Wikimedia Foundation and affiliates, other unconference and open source event organizers, and developers to come up with an open framework of ideas for engaging volunteers and communities both in advance of and after technical events so that new volunteers and non-profit / open source communities can stay engaged year round and both facilitate and plan in advance and continue work online afterwards.

[ Your longer project description goes here. Use this space to welcome newcomers, articulate the problem you're trying to solve, and explain your solution. For help on writing a good readme, see [this exercise](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/writing_readme/). ]

## Getting Started

Wikimedia has been able to attract all sorts of amazing volunteer developers to our in-person technical events, and this project is attempting to address two follow up issues that have been identifed as pain points for much of the open source community:  
1) Pre-event engagement: Participants may arrive without a social network, the tools for success, or ideas about what they might want to work on or who they want to work with. How can we get newcomers excited, involved and contributing before they meet in person.
2) Post event engagement: Participant may leave with a half finished project, a finished project that is never reviewed, merged, or publicized. They may be open and willing to work remotely with other developers on new projects but don't know how to stay involved. How can we retain the excitement and momentum from our events into the future and grow our community of developers?

This project is an attempt to compile strategies and ideas that have worked well for other communities, community organizers and events. We will also attempt to brainstorm new, untested ideas. This will all be documented on MediaWiki and here on GitHub and we will test out some of the best and most relevant ideas at our future Wikimedia events. Just like everything Wikimedia related we will continue to improve this over time even after the Mozilla Open Leaders project has wrapped up.


## Contributing

Hopefully this project will be useful by helping event organizers and community managers engage their communities year round. Helping open source projects continue momentum from in person events. 

I would really like to hear from anyone who has organized or attended an event that has had pre and post engagement. I want to hear from you about what worked and what what didnâ€™t work. I would also like to hear from anyone with any new untested ideas you might have.

I would also love to be connected to other event organizers that you know who have organized great events or who often come up with new ideas to test at events and might be interested in talking about this and meeting or working with me.
